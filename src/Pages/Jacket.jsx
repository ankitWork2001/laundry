                        Leather jackets are classy and stylish. They never go out of fashion, allowing you to continue using them for years to come. However, maintaining leather can be a bit daunting, but if done carefully, they look as good as new every time you wear them.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Know Your Leather</h2>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">It is significant that you understand the type of leather used to fashion your jacket. Leather is usually divided into five grades of leather:</p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-600 space-y-2">
                    <li>Full-grain leather</li>
                    <li>Top-grain leather</li>
                    <li>Split-grain leather</li>
                    <li>Genuine leather</li>
                    <li>Bonded leather</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The leather then has different finishing, including embossed, Nappa, nubuck, suede, die-cut, embroidered, patent, printed, split, aniline, brush-coloured, degrained, metallic, pigmented, waxy, semi-aniline, etc.</p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">The characteristics and quality of the material differ based on where the finishing of the hide is done. Other factors that may influence the quality of leather include the breed of animal, the food they have been fed, the climate they were raised in, the exercise they underwent, etc. Hides are natural, and the life of the animals is what impacts their quality.</p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Always remember to check the labels to determine the type of leather and the material of the lining from which it is made. Leather jackets are not meant to be washed using a washing machine or immersed in water. However, to prevent the build-up of grease or dirt, wiping it with a damp cloth and conditioning it helps in the build-up of mould. The jacket should be dried; naturally, it should not stay damp for long. Jackets with cotton or polyester lining can be maintained using the same method but if the lining is rayon or silk, then avoid doing anything at home. The job is meant for a specialist!</p>

                        If at all you spill something on your jacket, then you should refrain from rubbing it anxiously. Use a clean piece of cloth to dab and absorb it, and then allow it to dry naturally. You must never put it in a dryer.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-6">Leather jackets should never be folded; instead, you must hang them using a sturdy hanger. Always take off the plastic when it comes back from the dry cleaners; else, it may dry it out and give a flaky look to your leather jacket. Remember to empty the pockets when not using the jacket to prevent the leather from stretching.</p>
